## What is [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about)?
«Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other»

## Solutions
This repository contains (hopefully all by christmas) the solutions for the ongoing challenge.

I usually modify the puzzle input cuz parsing it in the code sucks ass. i.e. if I need to consume 5 inputs, I prepend the number 5 to those inputs so I know the size of the input beforehand and can create the data structures to hold the data (so ```a,1,b,2,c``` becomes ```5 a 1 b 2 c```).

There's also a lot of hardcoded constants in the code so keep that in mind.
